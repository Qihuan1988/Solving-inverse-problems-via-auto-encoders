1. autoencoder-celeba.py: training an AE;
2. AE-UNET_train.py: training a Unet;
3. AE-PGD_celeba.py: using AE-PGD method to reconstruct the images;
4. Unet-refine.py: using Unet to refine the reconstructed images generated from "AE-PGD_celeba.py";
5. plot_PSNR.py: plotting the PSNR figure by using the reconstruted images;
6. plot_images.py: generating some images to show the performance of different method.
