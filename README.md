# Solving-inverse-problems-via-auto-encoders
This folder contains the codes for the paper "Solving inverse problems via auto-encoders".
We use Pytorch to train the neural networks.
The Matlab codes are only for the BM3D-AMP method which is one of the comparison methods.
You can find the codes for different dataset are stored in different folders.
